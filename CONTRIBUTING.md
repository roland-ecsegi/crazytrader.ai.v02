Read `AGENTS.md`, `.agent/PLANS.md`, architecture/specs and current program status before coding. Substantial work requires an ExecPlan.

PR/task summaries should state goal, architecture impact, changed contracts/services, tests/gate evidence, security/financial impact, migrations and limitations.

TradeIntent, hard risk, OPA, execution, reconciliation, ledger, certification and secrets changes require explicit gate review plus negative-path tests.

In Autonomous Program Mode the gate review may be an independent adversarial Codex pass. Routine human approval is not required unless a true external blocker or binding decision exists.

Behavioral changes update matching specs. Do not skip roadmap gates.


Documentation checks are distinct from executable implementation evidence. Preserve historical audit provenance, map design fixes to pending test proof, and do not mark L1–L6 passed from prose. Use the current T000–T030 graph; no mandatory extra infrastructure or new permanent agents without a measured need.
