# CrazyTrader.ai V0.1

CrazyTrader.ai is an autonomous, agent-controlled crypto trading platform being built as an **Enterprise Local** product first, with a separate future Enterprise SaaS commercialization phase.

## Product target

Enterprise Local is the complete private product for one owner / one tenant. It must eventually support real-money Binance Spot trading after formal certification; the future SaaS phase is **not** required for the owner to trade live.

Core product requirements:

- **Math Mode**: quantitative/statistical live decision path; AI may research/orchestrate but does not replace the quantitative decision engine.
- **Strategy Mode**: validated/versioned strategies with **Low / Medium / High** risk profiles.
- Independent capital allocation and P&L for Math Mode and Strategy Mode.
- Permanent software agents with stable identity, real executable skills, governed memory, permissions, experience, and audit history.
- AI Gateway supporting Claude CLI/subscription workflows, Claude Agent SDK where supported, Claude API, and future providers.
- Autonomous research and controlled learning from historical data and the platform's own executed trades.
- Deterministic Hard Risk Engine, OPA policy enforcement, execution, reconciliation, ledger, kill switches, and recovery.
- Binance live key with **withdrawal disabled**; live credentials are owner-local secrets and are never exposed to Codex Cloud or LLM prompts.
- Backtest -> simulation -> paper -> shadow -> bounded canary -> L6 LIVE CERTIFIED.
- Custom product UI and business logic. Open-source components are infrastructure building blocks, not the product identity.

## Performance objective

The platform must optimize **sustainable risk-adjusted compounded return subject to survival, drawdown, liquidity, cost, and owner-capital constraints**.

There is **no guaranteed monthly return** and no hard-coded rule forcing a target such as 12%, 44%, 100% or a minimum number of trades. Zero trades is valid when the estimated edge does not clear costs and risk thresholds.

## Core operating principle

> AI proposes. Math calculates. Risk constrains. Policy authorizes. Execution executes. Exchange confirms. Ledger records. Agents learn.

## Financial trust boundary

Anything above the boundary may be wrong; anything below must be deterministic, constrained, auditable, recoverable, and fail-safe.

## Current state

Architecture/specification baseline audited on 2026-10-02. Implementation starts at Phase 0 and, in Autonomous Program Mode, proceeds automatically through the roadmap after each gate passes.

General live trading remains impossible before L6. The only pre-L6 real-money exception is the explicitly owner-authorized, owner-local, tightly bounded L5 canary required to collect evidence for L6; it uses withdrawal-disabled credentials and dedicated capital/policy limits.
